Schmandt, C. _Voice Communication with Computers: Conversational Systems_. New York, NY: Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1993. ISBN: 9780442239350.

Course Structure
----------------

The syllabus of this class will be approximately the table of contents of the book. We will add more recent case studies from the literature and have more to say about topics in spatialized audio, speech skimming, non-speech audio, and computer mediated voice communication.

Rather than a series of formal lectures, this course will be based on your reading for the week and asking questions / discussing in class. Thus it is difficult to predict an exact week-by-week syllabus in advance. This document will evolve during the term to reflect our actual rate of progress. During the last third of the semester, we will optionally cover additional topics in non-speech audio and user interfaces for mobile devices.

Grades and Policies
-------------------

There will be approximately 8 to 10 problem sets, which will be graded on a scale of 1 (awful) to 5 (great). There will be no exams or projects. Grades will be based on problem set performance, with a half-grade factor for class participation, including doing the readings.

Problem sets are due in class on the due date, and will be accepted only in hard copy (unless prior arrangements have been made). Problem sets will be accepted up until the day they are discussed in class, but submissions after the due date will incur a 1/2 point penalty. (Penalty waived if the instructor has more than two ungraded problem sets not yet returned). You can use whatever word processor or text formatter you want, but except in special cases hand written problem sets are not acceptable. Figures (flow charts, box drawings, etc.) may be hand drawn and labeled.
